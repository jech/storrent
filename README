Storrent
========

Storrent is a BitTorrent implementation that is optimised for streaming
media: it allows you to watch a movie or to listen to music from a Torrent
without downloading it entirely.

Storrent works entirely in RAM: except for the DHT bootstrap database, it
will never write anything to disk.  It requires a fair amount of memory
(1GB will do, 4GB is better).


Installation
------------

    git clone https://github.com/jech/storrent
    cd storrent
    CGO_ENABLED=1 go build

This will yield a binary called `storrent` or `storrent.exe`.

Running
-------

    ./storrent &
      
Now go to

    http://localhost:8088
    
and add a magnet link or a link to a torrent file.  Wait a few seconds,
then hit reload; you should see a link to a playlist which you may
download and feed to your favourite media player.


Command-line options
--------------------

    storrent -help
    
By default, storrent takes 1/2 of the total RAM on your machine.  You may
tune this with the `-mem` command-line flag:

    storrent -mem $((4 * 1024 * 1024)) &

By default, storrent attempts to open ports in your NAT box or firewall
using NAT-PMP, or, failing that, uPNP.  You may disable port mapping with
the `-portmap` flag:

    storrent -portmap=off

I usually run storrent in a slightly more paranoid mode than the default:

    storrent -force-encryption -dht passive

For privacy reasons, storrent doesn't use trackers or webseeds by default;
you may enable them on a torrent-by-torrent basis in the user interface.
Should you wish to override the default, do:

    storrent -use-trackers -use-webseeds
